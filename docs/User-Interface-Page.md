# Password phonetics
#### Disable text-to-speech function
The Access Manager web interface provides a text-to-speech function that will read out the value of the password in the NATO phonetic alphabet, where supported by the user's browser.

Selecting this option will hide the text-to-speech function in the web app.

#### Hide phonetic breakdown
The Access Manager web interface provides breakdown of the password in the NATO phonetic alphabet. This makes it easier to read passwords out loud to another person.

Selecting this option will hide the phonetic password breakdown in the web app.

#### Prefix upper-case letters with
Provide a value such as `upper-case` or `capital` to prefix letters with in the phonetic breakdown.

#### Prefix lower-case letters with
Provide a value such as `lower-case` to prefix letters with in the phonetic breakdown. We suggest prefixing only upper-case letters.

Specify how many characters should be in each group in the phonetic breakdown. This changes how many characters are displayed on each line in the phonetic breakdown.
